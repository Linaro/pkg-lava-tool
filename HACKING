Tests Code Coverage
===================

To have a nicely HTML viewable report on tests code coverage, do as follows:

* Install `python-coverage` (`pip install coverage` in case you use pip)
* Run the following command:

    python-coverage run -m unittest lava_tool.tests.test_suite 2>/dev/null && python-coverage html

* The report will be saved in a directory called `lava_tool_coverage`: open 
the `index.html` file in there to see the report.

Notes:

 * To re-run the coverage report, you have to delete the `lava_tool_coverage`
directory first, otherwise `python-coverage` will fail.
