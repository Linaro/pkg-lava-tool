About
=====

This source package contains the command-line tool for interacting
with the various services built by the Linaro (www.linaro.org)
Infrastructure Team.

Note that this package only contains the core tool; to actually
interact with a service you'll need to install a corresponding plugin.
XXX explain where to get some plugins.

Installation
============

See INSTALL

Usage
=====

Dealing with jobs

  $ lava job new file.json      # creates file.json from a template
  $ lava job submit file.json   # submits file.json to a remote LAVA server
  $ lava job run file.json      # runs file.json on a local LAVA device

Dealing with LAVA Test Shell Test Definitions

  $ lava testdef new file.yml      # creates file.yml from a template
  $ lava testdef submit file.yml   # submits file.yml to a remote LAVA server
  $ lava testdef run file.yml      # runs file.yml on a local LAVA device

Dealing with LAVA Test Shell Scripts

  $ lava script submit SCRIPT     # submits SCRIPT to a remote LAVA server
  $ lava script run SCRIPT        # runs SCRIPT on a local LAVA device

Bash completion
===============

Once lava-tool is installed, you can turn bash completion on for the `lava` and
`lava-tool` programs with the following commands (which you can also paste in
your ~/.bashrc):

  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete lava)"
  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete lava-tool)"

Then if you type for example "lava-tool su<TAB>", it will complete that "su"
with "submit-job" for you.

==============

All bugs should be reported to the launchpad project at
