About
=====

This source package contains the command-line tool for interacting
with the various services built by the Linaro (www.linaro.org)
Infrastructure Team.

Note that this package only contains the core tool; to actually
interact with a service you'll need to install a corresponding plugin.
XXX explain where to get some plugins.

Installation
============

See INSTALL

Bash completion
===============

Once lava-tool is installed, you can turn bash completion on for the `lava` and
`lava-tool` programs with the following commands (which you can also paste in
your ~/.bashrc):

  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete lava)"
  eval "$(register-python-argcomplete lava-tool)"

Then if you type for example "lava-tool su<TAB>", it will complete that "su"
with "submit-job" for you.

Reporting Bugs
==============

All bugs should be reported to the launchpad project at
https://bugs.launchpad.net/lava-tool/+filebug
