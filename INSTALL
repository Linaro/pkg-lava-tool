Installation
============

Installation needs to be done via setup.py.  For the impatient,

$ python setup.py develop --user

is a least effort, minimally disruptive starting point.

This will put a script you can invoke in ~/.local/bin/. You may need to include
that directory into your path.

To undo this process do:

$ python setup.py develop --user --uninstall
$ rm -f ~/.local/bin/lava-tool

Note that for various reasons the actual program (lava-tool) is not removed by
this step. Because this program is automatically generated it is safe to remove
it manually at any time.
