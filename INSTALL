The following script is suitable for installation in /opt (code & settings) and /srv (data).
(the script is meant to be read and executed manually, you need to interact with some steps)

	mkdir -p /opt/dashboard/
	mkdir -p /srv/dashboard/media
	bzr get lp:launch-control/stable/0.1 /opt/dashboard/stable
	cp /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/local_settings.py.example /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/local_settings.py
	/opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/manage.py syncdb
	chown -R www-data.www-data /srv/dashboard/
	cp /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/dashboard
	
	# Tweak to your preference, default is to have a *:80/dashboard/ virtual host
	$EDITOR /etc/apache2/sites-available/dashboard
	sudo a2enside dashboard
	sudo service apache restart

Now go to your-site/dashboard/admin and login
