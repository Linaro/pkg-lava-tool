The following script is suitable for installation in /opt (code & settings) and /srv (data).
(the script is meant to be read and executed manually, you need to interact with some steps)

	mkdir -p /opt/dashboard/
	mkdir -p /srv/dashboard/media
	bzr get lp:launch-control/0.1 /opt/dashboard/stable
	
	# Things to do here:
	# 1) specify system administrators
	# 2) set SECRET_KEY
	# 3) configure database settings
	# 4) confirm installation and data paths
	cp /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/local_settings.py.example /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/local_settings.py
	/opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/manage.py syncdb
	chown -R www-data.www-data /srv/dashboard/
	cp /opt/dashboard/stable/dashboard_server/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/dashboard
	
	# Tweak to your preference, default is to have a *:80/dashboard/ virtual host
	$EDITOR /etc/apache2/sites-available/dashboard
	a2ensite dashboard
	service apache restart

Now go to your-site/dashboard/admin and sign-in with the username and password you provided.
Before the system can be used you must create an anonymous bundle stream. You can do this
by selecting "Bundle Streams" "Add" and "Save" from the admin panel.
