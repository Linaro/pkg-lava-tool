lava-tool (0.19-1) unstable; urgency=medium

   lava-tool has changed the backend for token storage.

   This means that existing authentications will not be usable to this
   new version. This change has been made to fix persistent problems with
   the python-keyring support, including:
   * DBus errors when used over SSH
   * Interaction with gnome-keyring causing authentication failure
   * Inability to list or remove authentications added to the keyring
   * Inability to work with other keyring solutions.

   The new backend is able to list and remove authentications. The new
   support also removes the need for a default password on the user
   keyring, so lava-tool will no longer pause waiting for password
   entry.
